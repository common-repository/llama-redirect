=How it works?=


_Step-by-step process_:

When website user is accessing a page, the page data goes to WordPress core, Llama Redirect Plugin "catches" the request URL and checks if there are any redirect settings created.

_How it works_:

* Website user is requesting a page
* Request URL goes to WordPress, and it is processing request
* WordPress sends the current requested URL to Plugin's function* an action, registered when you activate the plugin
* The requested URL is being checked in your redirect rules (plugin settings)
* If a rule is found and other settings match the current state* redirect rule is activating
* First of all, user data is logged (Browser, OS, URLs, date-time) if you enabled the logging
* Then Plugin sends the redirect action to WordPress
* WordPress transfers the user to another URL (according to your settings) and sends the server response code.
* User was redirected and he sees the target URL
